# Rational Calculator
The aim of this calculator is to try to represent numbers in a non floating point way.

For example, instead of representing 1/2 as 0.5, the calculator retains 1/2 in it's rational form. The calculator is capable of evaluating basic expressions and follows the order of operations.
